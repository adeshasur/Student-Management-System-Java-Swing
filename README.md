subject     — Subject catalogue
exam        — Exam records

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher installed and added to `PATH`
- Windows OS

### Run the Application

**Option 1 — PowerShell (Recommended)**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run_project.ps1
```

**Option 2 — Batch File**

```batch
run.bat
```

The script will automatically:

1. Create the `build/classes` output directory
2. Build a symlink junction to handle classpath spaces
3. Compile all `.java` source files
4. Copy image and report resources to the build directory
5. Launch the application

> The H2 database file is created automatically at `data/schoolmanagment.mv.db` on first run and seeded with sample data.
